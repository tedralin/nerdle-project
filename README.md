How to play this clone of the Nerdle Game:
Similar to the Nerdle game:
1.  You have 6 tries to guess the Nerdle Equation.
2.  After each guess, the colors of the tiles/boxes will change to show the matched/partial match/unmatched numbers and operators.
3.  Green shows an exact match on the value and the position.
    Maroon shows a match in the value, but not the position.
    Gray shows that the value entered does not exist in the nerdle equation.

Rules:
1.  Each guess should result in a proper equation.
2.  It follows the MDAS rule.   1+2*3 = 7 not 9.
3.  Equations are NOT cummulative.   20+31=51   will not match to 31+20=51.
